\frametitle{HIP-based alignment procedures}
\textcolor{darkblue}{1. Full-scale alignment of chambers to tracker (10 and 100~pb$^{-1}$, \\ \hfill not startup)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{darkblue}{Basic idea:} tracker provides good tracks, we move
muon chambers to minimize ``track-minus-hit'' residuals on average
\item Therefore alignment is automatically relative to tracker
\item Residuals distributions are wide due to multiple scattering
\begin{itemize}
\item Gain precision by re-fitting tracks with different hit weights
in tracker and in each muon station
\item We use muon Alignment Parameter Errors (APEs) to set these
hit weights: APEs have been behaving as expected since last summer
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{darkblue}{2. Relative alignment of CSCs (low energy tracks \\ \hfill and/or beam-halo)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Locally fit tracks that pass through CSC overlap regions (again,
by setting APEs)
\item Align CSC chambers relative to their neighbors
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{darkblue}{4. Alignment of large structures to tracker (first collisions)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Treat large structures (barrel wheels and endcap rings) as individual alignable objects
\item Compliments relative measurements in combined \mbox{start-up program \hspace{-1 cm}}
\item Very few tracks needed: 1000~muons (0.1~pb$^{-1}$) yields \mbox{400~$\mu$m \hspace{-0.5 cm}} global precision when chambers have 500~$\mu$m local precision

\begin{itemize}
\item Test full-scale procedure on top and bottom chambers in muon
barrel (1 million muons through tracker?), possibly as far as ME1/3 (10k muons?)

but this is primarily a test of the procedure

\begin{itemize}

alignment; procedures will be developed with these in mind

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Comparisons with hardware}

Opportunities for comparison with hardware alignment available in
\begin{itemize}
\item MTCC relative alignment of CSCs: hardware alignment already
exists and compares favorably with photogrammetry

\item Chambers selected for CRA0T/CRAFT alignment

\item Relative alignment of CSCs during beam-halo period (June)

\item Position of large structures relative to tracker in the first weeks of collisions
\end{itemize}

How would we do that comparison?
\begin{itemize}
\item Database comparison tool applied to alignment output in SQLite files (under development)
\end{itemize}

\vfill
\hspace{-0.83 cm} \textcolor{darkblue}{\Large {\it Combining} track-based and hardware alignment data?}

After verifying a mutually-measured direction, for example
\begin{itemize}
\item beam-halo and SLM lasers both measure CSC $r\phi$
\item only SLM lasers measure CSC $z$: use it if $r\phi$ agrees
\end{itemize}

%   * Do systematics studies on re-optimized procedure, startup procedures, cosmic ray tests
%   * Update expected effect of misalignment on muon tracks, physics quantities
%   * apply procedure to CRAFT dataset
%     * compare with hardware measurements

\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0.4 cm}
\item While still working on full-scale procedure, we are focusing on
start-up
\item All HIP-related software is done (in 2\_0\_X) except monitoring plots
\item We're not waiting for MC: we can use existing samples
\item We can test beam-halo procedure in MTCC as soon as we're ready
\item With this timeline, we'll be ready for CRA0T/CRAFT data when
it becomes available
\item We'll also get as much information as we can from beam-halo
before first collisions
